# Bad-Advice-Bot-Revised-
Here is the twitter bot I did back in the first couple weeks revised! Though there wasn't much I really wanted to change about the idea I added some things and fixed some grammatical errors.

When it comes to this bot I wasn't quite satisfied with the end results, I didn't like the amount of variety I had so I decided to try and add a couple more things. I put some more phrases in the origin section as well as a couple new words within the code itself. It also was annoying to see all the grammatical errors since none of my #objects# had the proper articles like 'a' and 'an' so I went through every word and changed that. 

I like the project a lot more now and there's nothing I would think to change other than those things, I also think it should be reaching higher than the supposed word count because before I'm pretty sure it didn't.
